# COMP335 Job Scheduling Project

With the increased demand for distributed systems, it is imperative that there is an implemented and maintained way of scheduling jobs that are sent to it. Without such a system, it would be impossible to maintain and ensure that tasks are completed without interfering with one another. With this project, we have the objective of implementing a job scheduler for a simulated distributed system. The server-side part of the project has already been developed and provided to us. We must implement the client-side portion and ensure that it is compliant with the existing system.
