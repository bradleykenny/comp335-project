### STAGE 1 DEMO INSTRUCTIONS

PRE: 	Within the environment, we need to contain the server simulation (provided by Young), and the config file/s
		are to be used on the client simulator. An example environment is shown below.

	|_ Client.java
	|_ config_simple1.xml
	|_ config_simple2.xml
	|_ config_simple3.xml
	|_ ds-server


STEPS FOR DEMO:
	1. Enter the directory containing the files we want to use for the demonstration.
	2. Run the command "javac Client.java" to compile the Java file.
	3. Run the server using the relevant command.
		a. In the case of ds-server, it would be "./ds-server -c <config_file> -v all". (Using all to show entire 
		output; could use something else).
	4. Run the client using "java Client". This will enable the simulation.
	5. Observe output.
