### STAGE 3 DEMO INSTRUCTIONS

PRE: Within the environment, we need to contain the server simulation (provided by Young), and the config file/s are to be used on the client simulator. An example environment is shown below.

	ds-sim/29May2019
	|_ ds-config-s3-1.xml
	|_ ds-config-s3-2.xml
	|_ ds-config-s3-3.xml
	|_ ds-config-s3-4.xml
	|_ ds-config-s3-5.xml
	|_ ds-config-s3-7.xml
	|_ ds-server
	|_ ds-client
	
	stage3_submission/source
	|_ Client.java
	|_ Cluster.java
	|_ Job.java
	|_ Server.java


STEPS FOR DEMO:
	1. Enter the directory containing the files we want to use for the demonstration.
	2. Run the command "javac Client.java" to compile the Java file.
	3. Run the server using the relevant command.
		a. In the case of ds-server, it would be "./ds-server -c <config_file> -v all". (Using all to show entire output; could use brief).
	4. Run the client using "java Client -a mf". This will start the simulation using the 'My Fit' algorithm.
	5. Observe output.
